This repo is the place for both server & alerts of Speculare, doing it this way to share models and some common code.

Server is intended to recieve data from speculare-client childrens.

Alerts is intended to create incidents and send notifications about them.

This project is meant to evolve in something more complete and more complexe in a somewhat near future.

Server setup / Dev setup
--------------------------

- Install all deps
```bash
$ curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
$ sudo apt-get install cmake libssl-dev libpq-dev pkg-config build-essential
```

- Create both Alerts.toml and Server.toml files based on Example*.toml

> **âš  WARNING: The TimescaleDB instance you're going to use need to be configured for logical replication, check the [docs](https://docs.speculare.cloud).**

- (Solution A - recommended) Setup the database without doing anything
```
You might just have to create the database (inside psql `CREATE DATABASE name`).
When running the binary, it will automatically check if all available migrations have been applied. So you don't have to do anything, just launch and enjoy.
```

- (Solution B) Setup the database based on diesel
```bash
# Install the diesel_cli tool
$ cargo install diesel_cli --no-default-features --features postgres
# For diesel setup to works you need to be at the root of the project
$ diesel setup --database-url="postgres://xxx"
```
If you've installed the diesel_cli you can also use it's migration commands
```bash
$ diesel migration run/add/revert/redo --database-url="postgres://xxx"
```
